# Our Process
**Tools:**
1. Define parameter for desired content
2. Identify relevant YT channels, searches and videos
3. Gather hundreds of videos with ytdlp + begin selecting & gathering comments from different videos
4. Process & algorithmically chop & edit video based on keywords & phrases using ![ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org//) & ![videogrep](https://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep) 
7. Hand-edit & sort comments into desired narrative
8. Write a quick static webpage with a fun auto scroll feature to display it all!
